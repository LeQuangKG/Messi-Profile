Previous studies on elite football players in Sweden found that a quality identified as ‘game intelligence’ – the ability to think abstractly and plan quickly – became more pronounced the more elite a player was. It won’t be surprising to hear that Messi breaks even more records in this arena.             </span>        </div>                <div id="bodyDiv" style="display:none; opacity:0;">        	<span class="textTitle" style="left: 297px; top: 31px;">BODY</span>            <span class="text" style="right:20px; top: 95px; left:10px;">            It is now relatively common knowledge that Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency when he was 11. This meant that his body was not producing enough of the chemicals that give its different parts signals to grow. The price of treatment – about $1,000 a month over two years – was too expensive for his family, or even Argentinian giants River Plate, who were interested in signing him, to pay. This led his father to approach Barcelona, who after quite a lot of trials and interpersonal battles, agreed to sign him and pay for the treatment. Messi was able to reach a normal height for his age, and the rest is history.             </span>        </div>                <div id="footDiv" style="display:none; opacity:0;">        	<span class="textTitle" style="left: 296px; top: 20px;">LEGS</span>            <span class="text" style="right: 20px; top: 89px; left:10px;">            There is probably no other set of muscles more essential to a professional football player than those in their legs.Football clubs that have invested millions in players are therefore quite protective of them. Barcelona have not publicized just how much they have insured Messi’s legs for,but as a point of reference, Cristiano Ronaldo’s are insured for 100 million euros. This means that if he lost use of his legs, an insurance company would have to pay him 100 million euros. Considering what a long-term investment he is for Barcelona, its wouldn’t be wrong to expect Messi’s as being valued even higher.             </span>        </div>                <div id="wrapper">        	<!--<div id="proLine" 	style=" display:block"></div>-->        	<div id="bodyLine" 	style=" display:none; width:0px;"></div>            <div id="headLine1" style=" display:none; width:0px;"></div>            <div id="headLine2" style=" display:none; height:0px;"></div>            <div id="footLine1" style=" display:none; width:0px;"></div>            <div id="footLine2" style=" display:none; height:0px"></div>                    </div>    </body></html>
